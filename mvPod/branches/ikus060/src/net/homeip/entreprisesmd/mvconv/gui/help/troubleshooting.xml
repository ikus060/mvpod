				<answer><para>Try using the default video bitrate of 450 and audio bitrate of 128.  If that does not work, run the problematic video through the "Join Videos" job as that will rebuild the AVI header that may help it to be played.</para></answer>

				<question><para>The audio is out of sync with the video.</para></question>
				<answer><para>After the video starts playing on your iriver, rewind it about a second or two.  This tends to get everything back on track.  Otherwise, try lowering the video bitrate to 320.  If you still get problems with sync play around with the manual sync function of iriverter as documented in <xref linkend="sync" />.</para></answer>
