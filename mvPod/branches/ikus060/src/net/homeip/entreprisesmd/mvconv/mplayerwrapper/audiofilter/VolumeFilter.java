/**
 * This filter implements software volume control. Use this filter with caution
 * since it can reduce the signal to noise ratio of the sound. In most cases it
 * is best to set the level for the PCM sound to max, leave this filter out and
 * control the output level to your speakers with the master volume control of
 * the mixer. In case your sound card has a digital PCM mixer instead of an
 * analog one, and you hear distortion, use the MASTER mixer instead. If there
 * is an external amplifier connected to the computer (this is almost always the
 * case), the noise level can be minimized by adjusting the master level and the
 * volume knob on the amplifier until the hissing noise in the background is
 * gone. This filter has a second feature: It measures the overall maximum sound
 * level and prints out that level when MPlayer exits. This volume estimate can
 * be used for setting the sound level in MEncoder such that the maximum dynamic
 * range is utilized.
 * 
 * NOTE: This filter is not reentrant and can therefore only be enabled once for
 * every audio stream.
 * 
 * WARNING: This feature creates distortion and should be considered a last
 * resort.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE: mplayer âˆ’af volume=10.1:0 media.avi Would amplify the sound by
 * 10.1dB and hard-clip if the sound level is too high.
